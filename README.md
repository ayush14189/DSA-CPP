# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** practice repository!  
This repo contains all the C++ code I wrote while learning DSA through a structured course. It includes topic-wise implementations, problem-solving approaches, and optimized solutions to build a strong foundation in competitive programming and technical interviews.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A personal learning archive for DSA concepts
- A quick reference guide for commonly used patterns and solutions
- A preparation tool for coding interviews and online assessments

---

## 🛠️ Language & Tools

- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** g++ (C++17/C++20)
- **IDE:** VS Code / CodeBlocks / CLion *(optional)*
- **Build Tool (optional):** Makefile / CMake

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific DSA topic. Topics include:

- 🧮 Arrays & Strings  
- 🪢 Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- 🗃️ Stacks & Queues (Monotonic Stack, Deque, etc.)  
- 🌳 Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Tree Traversals)  
- 🐚 Recursion & Backtracking  
- 🧮 Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
- 📊 Hashing & Maps  
- ⏱️ Sliding Window & Two Pointers  
- 📐 Bit Manipulation  
- 💰 Greedy Algorithms  
- 🎯 Binary Search on Answer  
- 🧩 Divide and Conquer  
- 🧮 Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation, Space Optimization)  
- 🔗 Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Topo Sort, Dijkstra, Union-Find)  
- 🧪 Miscellaneous: LRU Cache, Tries, Segment Trees, etc.
